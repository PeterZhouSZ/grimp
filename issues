1. No eigenvalues equal to one.
    => Round off existing eigenvalues and check again.
    => Rounding has to be arbit...

2. More than one eigenvalue equal to one
    => Components (assume that this is an if-and-only-if-condition)
    => Graph is already separated
    => Random walk won't work
    => Present the results then and there

3. One particular eigenvalue with very high multiplicity (not equal to one)
    => This eigenvalue represents a flat background.
    => Two nodes which are exactly identical will have the same weights to all other nodes, and weights of 1 to each other.
    => Flat backgrounds can be directly detected in this way.

4. On increasing the patch size, the entropy values explode and all weights go to zero.
    => Scale entropy values depending upon the patch size.
    => Find out the natural "scale" of the feature vector (given a patch size) and non-dimensionalize it
